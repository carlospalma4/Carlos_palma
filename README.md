This is how my repository can be installed
```
git clone https://github.com/carlospalma4/Carlos_palma.git
cd Carlos_palma
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate notebook
```
Once this is done, the notebook may be ran by the line `jupyter notebook` which will run JupyterHub. Shift + Enter may be used. Use the command `git clone https://github.com/carlospalma4/Carlos_palma.git` to clone the repository. 

Some of my favorite earth science topics include geomorphology, glaciology, and oceanography. I chose the MIT-LIcensing because it matches that of the general repository and because it is very accessible and straightforward with respect to permissions.
